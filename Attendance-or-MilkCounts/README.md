Associate with a Google Sheet that has one Sheet per Class.  Every Sheet will become an Answer in a Dropdown item in the Google Form.  When that Answer is chosen, the next page will be the names listed in the first column of the page.
Changing the Spreadsheet will update the Form when the trigger is installed.

We use this in conjunction with FormMule/CopyDown to email our Milk Count numbers to the cafeteria on a daily basis.  There is a summary email which is set on a daily trigger and a onSubmit() trigger which mails the inidvidual Teachers responses to the cafeteria staff when a form is filled out (because they wanted it that way).
