Associate with a Google Sheet that has one Sheet per Class.  Every Sheet will become an Answer in a Dropdown item in the Google Form.  When that Answer is chosen, the next page will be the names listed in the first column of the page.
Changing the Spreadsheet will update the Form when the trigger is installed.
