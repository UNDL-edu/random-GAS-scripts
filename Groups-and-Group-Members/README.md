Must be with a Google Sheet (eventually make as an addon)
Clears all the data from the first Sheet of a Spreadsheet and imports the Groups and their Members in coumns.  Could quite possibly be changed into a Group Inventory Addon for Sheets, akin to Chromebook Inventory, with the ability to update Groups, though this is currently not a feature in this script (but is a function within "Group OU Sync", another project).  

Requires AdminSDK
