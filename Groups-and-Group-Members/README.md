Must be associated with a Google Sheet (eventually could make this an addon for Sheets).
Clears all the data from the first Sheet of a Spreadsheet and imports the Groups and their Members in coumns.  Could quite possibly be changed into a Group Inventory Addon for Sheets, akin to Chromebook Inventory, with the ability to update Groups, though this is currently not a feature in this script (but is a function within "Group OU Sync", another project).  

Lines 21 and 39 include code which is commented out that would exclude groups from the inventory, such as Student, Staff, or other Groups that fit in a Regular Expression.

Requires AdminSDK
