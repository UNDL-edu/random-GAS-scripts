<b> Clear Descriptions</b>:
I was asked in a forumn if there was a fast way to remove all the descriptions from all groups. This was the result.
Requires AdminSDK to be enabled.

<b> Remove Empty Contact Groups</b>
Again, someone asked if there was a way to clear all of their empty groups from their Contacts. No AdminSDK, but does require the ContactsApp to be enabled.

<b> Groups and Group Members</b>:
Must be associated with a Google Sheet (eventually could make this an addon for Sheets).
Clears all the data from the first Sheet of a Spreadsheet and imports the Groups and their Members in coumns.  Could quite possibly be changed into a Group Inventory Addon for Sheets, akin to Chromebook Inventory, with the ability to update Groups, though this is currently not a feature in this script (but is a function within "Group OU Sync", another project).  

Lines 21 and 39 include code which is commented out that would exclude groups from the inventory, such as Student, Staff, or other Groups that fit in a Regular Expression.

Requires AdminSDK to be enabled.
