This script is set to run on a schedule, once a week.  An email is generated for each of the email accounts and sent to the respective manager.

This could have been more elegant, creating 2 arrays (one for managers, one for subs) and looping through a for statement rather than 3 objects calling the function manually 3 times, but either way works.  If I were making this as an addon, I believe I would use the 2 array method.
