Robert Petitto requested -
 
Aside from using BetterCloud or GAMs, is there any way to easily update our students in bulk.  Specifically, I'd like to remove their Alias which shows up in the directory.

This is my solution -
OK - Here's the Script to do just what +Robert Petitto  asked - Remove all aliases from a limited group (Based on OUs).
You will need to enable the AdminSDK in the Dev Console and the Advanced Preferences (both in the same dropdown).
